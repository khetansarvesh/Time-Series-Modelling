This is a special type of data because in this type of data sequence in which things have happened matters.

## Step 1 : Feature Engineering
- Here we donâ€™t do train validation test split cause it will break the sequence information!!

## Step 2 : Model Building => Supervised Machine Learning => Regression (Time Series Forecasting) Problem
Time series modelling usually deals with regression task on time series based dataset, below we will see algorithms to do this!!

1. [<ins> Univariate Time-Series-Forecasting (1 feature dataset) </ins>](https://github.com/khetansarvesh/Time-Series-Modelling/tree/main/univariate_time_series)
2. [<ins> Multivariate Time-Series-Forecasting (>1 feature dataset) </ins>](https://github.com/khetansarvesh/Time-Series-Modelling/tree/main/multivariate_time_series)

These are also called sequential models because we are using them to solve a sequential problem.
