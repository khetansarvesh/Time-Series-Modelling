# Time-Series-Modelling

To understand theory go to my notes at following link (recommended) : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1y3VNtNawi8j7H_42IPRS2xVeNl_mRqYm?usp=sharing

In my notes I have given a detailed explaination of how one can solve the univariate time series problem using even a FFNN but since there exists a problem in solving with FFNN it motivated the idea of RNN, what is this problem?? Read my notes to understand same. Now there exists a problem with RNN i.e. vanishing and exploding gradients which motivates the idea of LSTMs and since these exists a problem with LSTMs it motivated the idea of GRUs. To solve the parallel computation problem with GRUs the idea of transformer based models poped up.


# LSTM
