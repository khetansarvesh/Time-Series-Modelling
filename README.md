Feature Engineering
Model Building => Supervised Machine Learning => Regression (Time Series Forecasting)  Problem
This is a special type of data because in this type of data sequence in which things have happened matters.Though the problem seems the same as regression but we don't use regression algorithms to solve time series problems.

Before learning time series analysis you need to learn the math subject - numerical analysis 

Here we donâ€™t do train validation test split , we didn't  train validation split.


Time series modelling usually deals with regression task on time series based dataset, below we will see algorithms to do this!!
